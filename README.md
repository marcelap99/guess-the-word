#### Project Built with mobile first approach. Responsive break point at min-width: 768px; Used Responsive-Design-Testing-Master by Matt Kersley as guide.

#### The game starts with a word on the screen. Circle symbols act as placeholders for each letter. Players start by entering a letter. If they guess correctly, the letter appears in the word. If they guess incorrectly, they learn how many guesses they have remaining. The player can also see which letters they’ve already guessed.

#### The game lets the player know if they’ve already guessed a letter or entered a non-alphabetic character! If the player guesses all the letters correctly before they use up their allotted guesses, they win! A Play Again button appears at the end of the game to prompt the player to give it another try.
